        <h1>Concept For Chaos Knight</h1>
<h2>Game Development</h2>
<p>Currently at the moment I'm testing out different styles of pixel art to see if they'll work well with Minetest type voxel graphics, but long term plan I'm wanting to pursue is either Gobot or Hamster Engine.</p>
<p>But what I'm not sure is if some of the gameplay elements I have in mind will carry over to an engine that's more like RPG Maker:</p>
<p>The primary setting is a desert like world. The MC, the bringer of chaos, must bring order to chaos. This chaos comes in the form of a corruption of snow and desert blocks that infect and consume other blocks. By contrast, there are rejuvination blocks that allow the MC to nuetralize the corruption blocks. One traverses over said blocks by crafting &quot;boot blocks&quot; that one can walk over without risk of being poisoned or damaged.</p>
<p>Right now I'm wanting something like a tactical battle system found in games like FF Tactics or Grandia, but I'm not sure how easily such mechanics would work for Minetest. So most of my develop these has been mostly on a graphical level.</p>
<h2>Current Plot</h2>
<p>As of right now I'm moving in the direction of setting this game in the same world as my fiction series, but the underlying issues is this means that increasingly my games are becoming more and more alternative history: generally there are Japanese controlled parts of the US, and French controlled parts of the US. This means that part of the gameplay would involve learning how to understand both Parisienne French, Surfer Francais, and Nihongo.</p>
<p>The games are set after an long civil war between Japanese loyalists and French loyalists whom are loyal to different fascist regimes. This would inform that way that certain weapons, clothing, and other things are developed. Including fashion.</p>
<p>Current I'm wanting resistance strongholds to be set somewhere in the midwest as they're regions that are not completely controled by imperialist France, or imperialist Japan. Many of these strongholds will likely be underground. And I'm considering the MC being apprehended and guillotined one game over sequence.</p>
<p>I'm considering blending both Francophone and Japanese mythology together, such as interactions between Loup Garou and Yokai.</p>
<p>And that brings me to:</p>
<h2>Other Issues</h2>
<p>At the moment I'm also torn between finishing my graphic novel and other artistic hobbies. And now these days I've been kind of inundated with &quot;High Fashion&quot; related videos, even if I've tended to see myself more like a costume designer for Musical Theatre and Games.</p>
<p>It's certainly not something I want my more clothing design career to me, as I have other artistic hobbies I want to pursue.</p>
<p>All this being said, I feel like game development is going to end up taking longer than I anticipated because of the way the YT algorithm has been.</p>
